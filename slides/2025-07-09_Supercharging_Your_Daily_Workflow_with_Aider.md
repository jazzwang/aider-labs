# What is Aider?
- **AI Pair Programming in Your Terminal**: Aider allows you to pair program with Large Language Models (LLMs) directly from your terminal.
- **Works with Existing Codebases**: Ideal for starting new projects or building upon your current code.
- **Supports Various LLMs**: Works best with models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1 & Chat V3, OpenAI o1, o3-mini & GPT-4o, and can connect to almost any LLM, including local models.
- **Codebase Mapping**: Creates a map of your entire codebase to work effectively on larger projects.
- **Extensive Language Support**: Compatible with over 100 programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Ruby, Go, C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, etc.).
- **Git Integration**: Automatically commits changes with sensible messages, allowing easy diffing, management, and undoing of AI changes using standard Git tools.
- **IDE Integration**: Can be used from within your favorite IDE or editor by adding comments to your code.
- **Multimedia Context**: Supports adding images and web pages to the chat for visual context, screenshots, and reference documentation.
- **Voice-to-Code**: Enables speaking with Aider to request features, test cases, or bug fixes using your voice.
- **Linting & Testing Integration**: Automatically lints and tests code after changes, and can fix problems detected by linters and test suites.
- **Web Chat Compatibility**: Can streamline copy/pasting code with LLM web chat interfaces, though it works best with LLM APIs.
